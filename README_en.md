## Introduction

ChatGLM3 is a new generation of pre-trained dialogue models jointly released by Zhipu AI and Tsinghua KEG. ChatGLM3-6B is the open-source model in the ChatGLM3 series, maintaining many excellent features of the first two generations such as smooth dialogue and low deployment threshold, while introducing the following features:

1. **Stronger Base Model:** The base model of ChatGLM3-6B, ChatGLM3-6B-Base, adopts a more diverse training dataset, more sufficient training steps, and a more reasonable training strategy. Evaluations on datasets from various perspectives such as semantics, mathematics, reasoning, code, and knowledge show that **ChatGLM3-6B-Base has the strongest performance among base models below 10B**.

2. **More Complete Function Support:** ChatGLM3-6B adopts a newly designed [Prompt format](PROMPT_en.md), supporting multi-turn dialogues as usual. It also natively supports [tool invocation](tool_using/README_en.md) (Function Call), code execution (Code Interpreter), and Agent tasks in complex scenarios.

3. **More Comprehensive Open-source Series:** In addition to the dialogue model [ChatGLM3-6B](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/chatglm3-6b), the basic model [ChatGLM3-6B-Base](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/chatglm3-6b-base), and the long-text dialogue model [ChatGLM3-6B-32K](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/chatglm3-6b-32k) have also been open-sourced. All these weights are **fully open** for academic research, and **free commercial use is also allowed** after registration via a [questionnaire](https://open.bigmodel.cn/mla/form).

-----

The ChatGLM3 open-source model aims to promote the development of large-model technology together with the open-source community. Developers and everyone are earnestly requested to comply with the [open-source protocol](MODEL_LICENSE), and not to use the open-source models, codes, and derivatives for any purposes that might harm the nation and society, and for any services that have not been evaluated and filed for safety. Currently, no applications, including web, Android, Apple iOS, and Windows App, have been developed based on the **ChatGLM3 open-source model** by our project team.

Although every effort has been made to ensure the compliance and accuracy of the data at various stages of model training, due to the smaller scale of the ChatGLM3-6B model and the influence of probabilistic randomness factors, the accuracy of output content cannot be guaranteed. The model output is also easily misled by user input. **This project does not assume risks and liabilities caused by data security, public opinion risks, or any misleading, abuse, dissemination, and improper use of open-source models and codes.**

## Evaluation Results

### Typical Tasks

We selected 8 typical Chinese-English datasets and conducted performance tests on the ChatGLM3-6B (base) version.

| Model            | GSM8K | MATH | BBH  | MMLU | C-Eval | CMMLU | MBPP | AGIEval |
|------------------|:-----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:------:|:-----:|:----:|:-------:|
| ChatGLM2-6B-Base | 32.4  | 6.5  | 33.7 | 47.9 |  51.7  | 50.0  |  -   |    -    |
| Best Baseline    | 52.1  | 13.1 | 45.0 | 60.1 |  63.5  | 62.2  | 47.5 |  45.8   |
| ChatGLM3-6B-Base | 72.3  | 25.7 | 66.1 | 61.4 |  69.0  | 67.5  | 52.4 |  53.7   |
> "Best Baseline" refers to the pre-trained models that perform best on the corresponding datasets with model parameters below 10B, excluding models that are trained specifically for a single task and do not maintain general capabilities.

> In the tests of ChatGLM3-6B-Base, BBH used a 3-shot test, GSM8K and MATH that require inference used a 0-shot CoT test, MBPP used a 0-shot generation followed by running test cases to calculate Pass@1, and other multiple-choice type datasets all used a 0-shot test.

We have conducted manual evaluation tests on ChatGLM3-6B-32K in multiple long-text application scenarios. Compared with the second-generation model, its effect has improved by more than 50% on average. In applications such as paper reading, document summarization, and financial report analysis, this improvement is particularly significant. In addition, we also tested the model on the LongBench evaluation set, and the specific results are shown in the table below.

| Model                |  Average |  Summary | Single-Doc QA |  Multi-Doc QA | Code | Few-shot | Synthetic | 
|----------------------|:-----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| ChatGLM2-6B-32K   |  41.5 | 24.8 | 37.6 | 34.7 |  52.8  |  51.3 | 47.7 | 
| ChatGLM3-6B-32K   |  50.2 | 26.6 | 45.8 | 46.1 |  56.2  |  61.2 | 65 |


## How to Use

### Environment Installation
First, you need to download this repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM3
cd ChatGLM3
```

Then use pip to install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It is recommended to use version `4.30.2` for the `transformers` library, and version 2.0 or above for `torch`, to achieve the best inference performance.

### Integrated Demo

We provide an integrated demo that incorporates the following three functionalities. Please refer to [Integrated Demo](composite_demo/README_en.md) for how to run it.

- Chat: Dialogue mode, where you can interact with the model.
- Tool: Tool mode, where in addition to dialogue, the model can also perform other operations using tools.
    ![tool](resources/tool.png)
- Code Interpreter: Code interpreter mode, where the model can execute code in a Jupyter environment and obtain results to complete complex tasks.

### Usage 

The ChatGLM model can be called to start a conversation using the following code:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("THUDM/chatglm3-6b", trust_remote_code=True)
>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("THUDM/chatglm3-6b", trust_remote_code=True, device='cuda')
>>> model = model.eval()
>>> response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, "Hello", history=[])
>>> print(response)
Hello üëã! I'm ChatGLM3-6B, the artificial intelligence assistant, nice to meet you. Feel free to ask me any questions.
>>> response, history = model.chat(tokenizer, "What should I do if I can't sleep at night", history=history)
>>> print(response)
If you're having trouble sleeping at night, here are a few suggestions that might help:

1. Create a relaxing sleep environment: Make sure your bedroom is cool, quiet, and dark. Consider using earplugs, a white noise machine, or a fan to help create an optimal environment.
2. Establish a bedtime routine: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. A consistent routine can help regulate your body's internal clock.
3. Avoid stimulating activities before bedtime: Avoid using electronic devices, watching TV, or engaging in stimulating activities like exercise or puzzle-solving, as these can interfere with your ability to fall asleep.
4. Limit caffeine and alcohol: Avoid consuming caffeine and alcohol close to bedtime, as these can disrupt your sleep patterns.
5. Practice relaxation techniques: Try meditation, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation to help calm your mind and body before sleep.
6. Consider taking a warm bath or shower: A warm bath or shower can help relax your muscles and promote sleep.
7. Get some fresh air: Make sure to get some fresh air during the day, as lack of vitamin D can interfere with sleep quality.

If you continue to have difficulty sleeping, consult with a healthcare professional for further guidance and support.
```

#### Load Model Locally
The above code will automatically download the model implementation and parameters by `transformers`. The complete model implementation is available on [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/chatglm3-6b). If your network environment is poor, downloading model parameters might take a long time or even fail. In this case, you can first download the model to your local machine, and then load it from there.

To download the model from Hugging Face Hub, you need to [install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) first, then run
```Shell
git clone https://huggingface.co/THUDM/chatglm3-6b
```

If the download from HuggingFace is slow, you can also download it from [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/models/ZhipuAI/chatglm3-6b).

### Web-based Dialogue Demo
![web-demo](resources/web-demo.gif)
You can launch a web-based demo using Gradio with the following command:
```shell
python web_demo.py
```

![web-demo](resources/web-demo2.png)

You can launch a web-based demo using Streamlit with the following command:
```shell
streamlit run web_demo2.py
```

The web-based demo will run a Web Server and output an address. You can use it by opening the output address in a browser. Based on tests, the web-based demo using Streamlit runs more smoothly.

### Command Line Dialogue Demo

![cli-demo](resources/cli-demo.png)

Run [cli_demo.py](cli_demo.py) in the repository:

```shell
python cli_demo.py
```

The program will interact in the command line, enter instructions in the command line and hit enter to generate a response. Enter `clear` to clear the dialogue history, enter `stop` to terminate the program.

### API Deployment
Thanks to [@xusenlinzy](https://github.com/xusenlinzy) for implementing the OpenAI format streaming API deployment, which can serve as the backend for any ChatGPT-based application, such as [ChatGPT-Next-Web](https://github.com/Yidadaa/ChatGPT-Next-Web). You can deploy it by running [openai_api.py](openai_api.py) in the repository:
```shell
python openai_api.py
```
The example code for API calls is as follows:
```python
import openai
if __name__ == "__main__":
    openai.api_base = "http://localhost:8000/v1"
    openai.api_key = "none"
    for chunk in openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="chatglm3-6b",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "‰Ω†Â•Ω"}
        ],
        stream=True
    ):
        if hasattr(chunk.choices[0].delta, "content"):
            print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="", flush=True)
```
